# Lab 7 ~ Vanilla HTTP Server

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
In this lab, we were tasked to create a simple HTTP server with the HTTP NodeJS module. We were also tasked to create a custom body parsing module for use in parsing the body of all **POST** and **PUT** requests. This also needed to integrate the Cowsay NPM package, and use `/cowsay` as an endpoint to post to, and utilize the `/cowsay?text={message}` query string for **GET** requests. **GET** and **POST** requests to these endpoints were to be tested using Jest.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired. `npm start` will start a nodemon localhost server listening on port 3000, unless otherwise specified.
